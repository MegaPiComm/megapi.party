<h3>What is Mega-Pi?</h3>
<p>Mega-Pi is the 3.14159… year class reunion for the MIT Classes of 2017, 2018 and 2019.</p>
 
<h3>When is Mega-Pi?</h3>
<p>July 7-10, 2022</p>
 
<h3>Where is Mega-Pi?</h3>
<p>ARIA Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, NV. Check your email for the link to book hotel rooms!</p>
 
<h3>When will registration open?</h3>
<p>Registration will likely go live in late April 2022.  Keep an eye on your email (make sure to whitelist megapi@mit.edu so our emails don’t get marked as spam) and follow the Mega-Pi Instagram for updates!</p>
 
<h3>How will hotel reservations work? Do we need to book our hotel rooms now?</h3>
<p>MegaPi Committee has reserved a room block at the ARIA Resort & Casino.  Attendees of MegaPi will have access to a subsidized rate once registration opens.  Most attendees choose to split a room with another attendee to reduce costs, and we hope to facilitate looking for roommates.  Stay tuned for more details when registration opens!</p>
 
<h3>When do people usually arrive for Mega-Pi?  When should I plan to leave?</h3>
<p>Check-in is usually Thursday evening and Friday Morning.  Generally there is a more relaxed activity planned for Thursday evening for those who arrive early with more events kicking off around noon on Friday.  The reunion typically concludes early Sunday afternoon.  More exact details will be published once the schedule is finalized and registration is open. </p>
 
<h3>Why am I not getting the emails?</h3>
<p>First, please check your spam folder, and be sure to whitelist emails from megapi@mit.edu.  Otherwise, we use an emailing service through the MIT Alumni Association, specifically MIT10 for Pi Reunion.  Log on to MIT10 with your Infinite Connection account, and under "My Account" confirm: (1) what email our messages are going to, (2) you are subscribed to the Events/Announcements list under "Email Preferences", and (3) what your preferred class year is. </p>

<h3>I want these emails to go to another email!</h3>
<p>Alums can update their own preferred email addresses by logging into their IC account and updating their preferences at alum.mit.edu, by going to log in > My Account > Subscriptions/Edit Profile/Email & Forwarding</p>

<h3>I accidentally unsubscribed from alumni emails! How do I resubscribe?!</h3>
<p>Please contact Alumni Records at mitalum@mit.edu or by calling 617-253-8270 or 800-648-1865 and make the request.</p>

<h3>I took some time off and graduated after 201x -- how do I get added to this list to hang with the rest of my classmates?</h3>
<p>You can update your preferred class year with the Alumni Association to be affiliated with the Class of 201X. To join a different class community, please contact Alumni Records at mitalum@mit.edu or by calling 617-253-8270 or 800-648-1865 and make the request.</p>

<p>Booking for tables opens 90 days prior to the event.  Contact Omnia/Hakkasan directly for more details.</p>

<h3>For events with a limited number of tickets, are tickets lotteried out or given on a first come, first served basis??</h3>
<p>First come, first served.</p>
                       
<h3>Are there refunds on registration?</h3>
<p>Registration can only be refunded during the early registration period. <strong>Please note, Mega-Pi Committee will not be offering registration refunds after early registration closes on May 31.</strong></p>

                       
<h3>Are there refunds on event tickets?</h3>
<p>Tickets to the MegaPi Kickoff presented by Floating Point Group and the Class Toast at Brooklyn Bowl can be refunded until May 31.  There are no refunds offered on any other event ticket through the Mega-Pi Committee. Any tickets purchased outside of MIT (e.g. Cirque de Soleil) are subject to the terms agreed to while purchasing. <strong>Please note, Mega-Pi Committee distributed refunds will not be offered after early registration closes on May 31.</strong> However, if you unfortunately can no longer attend one of the two flagship events (MegaPi Kickoff presented by Floating Point Group and the Class Toast at Brooklyn Bowl), please let us know so that we can offer your spot to alumni on the wait list.
</p>

<h3>Are tickets to events transferrable?</h3>
<p>Tickets for Drag Brunch, Escape Room, Cirque du Soleil, the Mat Franco magic show, and the stand-up comedy show can be transferred directly between attendees, once tickets have been distributed at the event. Pi Committee will not facilitate resale or transfers of tickets. Any tickets purchased outside of MIT (i.e. Omnia Nightclub) are subject to the terms agreed to while purchasing.</p>

<h3>Can I attend Pi Reunion without officially registering?</h3>
<p>The cost of registration goes towards offsetting the costs for the many free events offered throughout the weekend. Registration is required to attend all official Pi Reunion events, and all attendees, including non-MIT 2016 attendees, are highly encouraged to officially register.</p>

<h3>Do I have to register for the free events?</h3>
<p>Registering helps the Pi Committee estimate the attendance of each event.  Please do register for each free event you plan to attend.</p>
         
                                    
                                    <header class="major">
                                <h1>Hotel</h1>
									</header>
 
<h3>Can I stay somewhere else?</h3>
<p>Yes, but our special rates are only for the Bellagio and are contingent on reserving 90% of our block of rooms.</p>
 
<h3>What is the change / cancellation policy?</h3>
<p>It is attendee’s responsibility to submit a valid credit card number with the name as it appears on the card, billing address and credit card expiration date, or a deposit equal to the first night’s room/suite rate, and tax as a guarantee, at the time the attendee makes the reservation. Attendee’s credit card will be charged the first night’s room/suite rate and tax at that time. Individual room reservations not guaranteed will be automatically canceled by Hotel within fourteen (14) days of the reservation date.  Should Group request transfer of room deposits or attendee name changes, Hotel must receive written notification granting Group authorization to make such changes.  Refunds will be issued on individual attendee’s reservations only if canceled at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance of the confirmed arrival date.  All guaranteed reservations will be held until 6:00 a.m. only on the day after attendee’s confirmed arrival date.  Attendees must pay the balance of all room, resort fee, tax and incidental charges upon check-out.</p>
 

<h3>What kinds of amenities does the hotel offer?</h3>
<p>To learn more about the Aria’s amenities, see their website.</p>
 

<h3>Can I book / request that two or more rooms be near each other?</h3>
<p>You can book multiple rooms on one reservation, and the rooms should be near each other. You can also request rooms be near each other at check in but this would not be guaranteed.</p>
 

<h3>Can I put a number other than 2 or 4 people in a room?</h3>
<p>Yes! Any number between 1 and 4 people can stay in each room. You will need the information of who will be staying in your room at the time of booking. A reasonable amount of “name changes” requested after the reservations due date will be accepted provided the arrival and departure date remain the same as the original reservations and of the same room type and must be approved by Hotel prior to confirmation to the attendee.</p>
 

<h3>When do I need to reserve a room by?</h3>
<p>Rooms need to be booked and finalized by June 25th, 2019.</p>
